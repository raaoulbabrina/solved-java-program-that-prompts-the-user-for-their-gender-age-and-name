<br>
Write a java program that prompts the user in the Java console (using Scanner) or in a Dialog Box (using JOptionPane.showInputDialog)for their gender, age, and name. The program should use this information to instantiate(construct) a Person object using the Person class as template : Person.java

The program should suggest a pet based on the Person’s gender and age. You will need to use if else if statements. Make sure when displaying the Person’s name in the output to call the getName() method for the Person Object you created.
